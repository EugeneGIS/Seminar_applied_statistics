# Seminar_applied_statistics

This is the coursework of 21 Spring for the Master of Geography at the University of Bern.

In this course, I mainly chose and finish the content of multiple regressions and independently studied the book <An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R>.

I think this is a very interesting course that gave me a new understanding of statistics.
