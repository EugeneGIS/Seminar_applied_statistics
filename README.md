# Seminar_applied_statistics

In this course, I mainly chose and finish the content of multiple regressions and independently studied the book <An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R>.

This is the projectwork of 21 Spring for the Master of Geography at the University of Bern. My project is mainly based on the temperature data of Switzerland from 1985 to 2014 for temperature estimation.

I think this is a very interesting course that gave me a new understanding of statistics. So I chose to upload and save this project work.
